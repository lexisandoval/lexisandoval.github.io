By the end of the week I will have completed my final Flatiron porfolio project and coursework and to say I'm grateful is a vast understatement. After earning my B.S. in computer sciences and failing to earn any relevant professional experience during college, I was unable to get an interview, well, anywhere. I was lost and confused and I didn't know how I would ever become successful in the field. *Enter Flatiron School....*

Flatiron taught me programming languages that are used heavily in the software development world today and I am thankful to have these new tools under my belt. Since I began my bootcamp journey in January, I have learned countless life and software skills as I've pushed myself to be the best software developer that I can be. As a result... **I got a job**! I can't wait to move to Texas at the end of the summer and begin my full time position as a Full Stack Engineer and I truly owe it all to Flatiron. I firmly believe that it is my new-found confidence that I developed over the past 5 months that got me this job and I couldn't have done it without this bootcamp.

With that, I want to thank Flatiron for everything and I am eternally grateful for this experience.

For those still working on the coursework, keep pushing! Everything will turn out in the end :)
